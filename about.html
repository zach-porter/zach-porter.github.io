                <p>I am interested in how technology can impact the way people work, organize, and legitimize certain practices, but also how the social narratives, institutional responses, and uneven outcomes that follow are also shaping how technology is being developed and used.</p>

                </div>
                <p>A long tradition of inequality research in sociology has demonstrated how schools and school systems provide educationally differentiated and stratified environments that tend to reproduce existing social inequalities. As GenAI becomes increasingly embedded in education, these inequalities risk deepening. Students from higher socioeconomic households may benefit from enhanced digital tools and parental guidance, while those from disadvantaged backgrounds face exclusion or unmediated exposure to low-quality AI content. Ensuring that all children have equitable opportunities to learn, adapt, and thrive is essential to preventing new forms of digital and social stratification.</p>
                <p>The my current PhD research project Class, Learning, And Social Stratification in the era of AI, or CLASS-AI for short, examines how teachers, parents, and AI designers influence access, skills, and use of GenAI by students; factors that underpin the emergence of new inequalities in educational opportunity. GenAI represents a critical “emerging issue,” reshaping how young people learn, create, and interact with educational systems.</p>
                <p>The project uses a multi-layered, sequential research design that moves from public discourse to institutional practice and finally to technological design imaginaries. The first phase undertakes a longitudinal computational analysis of Reddit discussions between 2022 and 2027 among teachers and parents. The first phase uses sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and LLM-assisted deductive coding on Reddit to study how generative AI is legitimized, justified, and critiqued in parent- and education-focused communities. Building on this foundation, the second phase consists of semi-structured interviews with teachers and parents in DEIS and non-DEIS Dublin schools, examining how socioeconomic context influences the integration of GenAI into classroom practices and home learning. This stage provides a grounded account of how structural inequalities condition children’s ability to benefit from or be protected from GenAI. The final phase focuses on expert interviews with AI developers and designers, investigating how educational equity and child safety considerations are either embedded or omitted in the design of GenAI tools used in schools.</p>
                <p>By linking these layers, CLASS-AI uncovers the mechanisms through which childhood disadvantage is reproduced or mitigated in the era of AI. The study focuses not on achievement outcomes but on the emerging opportunities and constraints in educational opportunities, factors central to educational well-being. Ultimately, the project will offer insights to inform Irish policy and educational practice, contributing to safer, more equitable integration of GenAI in schools.</p>
