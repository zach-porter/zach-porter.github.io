            <p>This video project served as a personal statement and visual narrative for my application to graduate school. It showcases my career journey, research interests, and passion for understanding complex socio-technical systems. By combining storytelling with multimedia elements, I aimed to present a compelling case for the importance of narratives and how they impact human complex systems at multiple levels. This video reflects my commitment to using innovative formats to communicate complex ideas effectively.</p>

            <p>In this video, I take viewers on a journey through three elements: a moment in time in Panama, phase transitions in both physical and social contexts, as well as the shape of stories. Through the visual medium, I draw parallels between natural phenomena and societal changes, illustrating how small shifts can lead to significant transformations. This project combines my interests in complexity science and sociology, offering a unique perspective on how we understand and interpret the world around us.</p>

            <h2>Social Simulation Project</h2>
            <p>In this project, I utilized Python to develop a simulation that models social dynamics based on Schweighofer and Garcia’s Weighted Balance Opinion Model. This simulation explores how individual opinions and social influence evolve over time within a network. By adjusting parameters such as initial opinion distribution, influence weight, and network structure, I examined how consensus or polarization can emerge in social groups. This project highlights the power of computational methods in understanding and predicting complex social behaviors.</p>

            <h2>Strength of Weak Ties Revisited</h2>
            <p>This project delves into the concept of the 'Strength of Weak Ties' by sociologist Mark Granovetter, re-examining its relevance in the context of modern network theory. By analyzing the role of weak ties—relationships characterized by infrequent interaction—I explored their critical impact on information diffusion and community building. Through this analysis, I identified emerging trends and potential areas for further research, demonstrating how weak ties continue to play a pivotal role in the flow of information and social dynamics.</p>

            <h2>First Master's Thesis on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</h2>
            <p>My Master's thesis investigates the sociological implications of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Through a mixed-method case study, I analyzed how DAOs, as a novel form of organizational structure, challenge traditional concepts of governance, decision-making, and social interaction. This research integrates insights from organizational sociology and network science with real-world case studies to offer a comprehensive view of the challenges of decentralized governance. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how digital transformations are reshaping organizational landscapes.</p>
